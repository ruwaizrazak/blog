Without proper user insights, everything is an assumption. Data is an important component which is required to find out the user preferences.</p><p>Even though designers are not users, by studying your targeted audiences through researches and analysis we can get closer to the user base. To succeed, we have to understand how users are interacting with the product and what are the features they are not interacting with, or finding hard to interact with.</p><blockquote><em><em>By having access to a large volume of processed data, you will be able to understand what exactly you need for your product to make it appealing and functional.</em></em></blockquote><p>Also, the data you acquire from A/b tests, surveys, consumer research, concept tests would help you to gather valuable data, which will help you to get through the design process. With quality insights and understanding about your user’s behavior, you will be able to deliver a better experience to your users and thus stand out from the crowd.</p><blockquote>Quality insights and understanding about user behavior would help you to deliver better experience.</blockquote><p>With the help of the data you’ve collected you will be able to : <br>- Understand whether you are in the proper direction.<br>- Recognize future opportunities or possible problematic areas.<br>- Understand user trends and patterns<br>- Improvise your design.</p><p>As you are equipped with quantitative and qualitative data, you can be a better influence in making a decision. With this data, you will be able to advocate for the better design that would solve the existing pain-points while making the product more functional and appealing.</p><h1 id="is-quantitative-data-is-the-only-ingredient-we-need-for-understanding-the-problem">Is quantitative data is the only ingredient we need for understanding the problem?</h1><blockquote>Data-driven design is about using information gleaned from both quantitative and qualitative sources to inform how you make decisions for a set of users —<a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/data-driven-design/?source=post_page---------------------------" rel="noopener nofollow"> Invision</a></blockquote><p>On the contrary, if we just look into the numbers, we might not be able to understand what’s going wrong. While data would be able to give you the numbers, data is only as good as the questions you ask.</p><p>For example, when you look into data, you might be able to see that there is a user churn. But quantitative data alone might not be able to answer why it’s happening.</p><p>To understand the why part, we need to look at the qualitative analysis that we gathered from our studies. Let that be focus groups, surveys, playtests, concept tests, or even App Store reviews.</p><p>For eg: If you notice that there is a churn between step A and step B, the quantitative part can tell you how much that is. But the qualitative part will be able to tell you why it’s happening.</p><p>But at this part, we also need to keep in mind that sometimes users don’t act as they say. I often caught up in a situation in which users say ” I like that feature” but when we check the numbers, it’s really low. At this stage, things get a bit complicated as users are saying they like a certain feature but they are not engaging with it. During these scenarios, as a designer, we have to check it with other sources of data and to use designer instincts.</p><h1 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h1><p>You do not have to be proficient in Python/R or does some SQL queries. While those skills are handy, its always better to have a look at different sources of data and to understand the depth of the problem before jumping into it.</p><p>Analyze your current users, there are lots of tools that would help you in this process. Look at your site’s analytics, behavior flow and engagement to understand what your users are doing. Once you get hold of this, dive deeper into your audience analytics and demographics to understand your user personas.</p><p>Along with this, A/b testing would help you to isolate specific variables of your user experience which would then help you to find the most effective options. Setting up milestones and experiment with smaller changes rather than throwing it all to the users would help you in pursuit of the great design.</p><h1 id="references">References</h1><ul><li><a href="https://capturly.com/blog/what-is-data-driven-ux/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://capturly.com/blog/what-is-data-driven-ux/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/data-driven-design/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/data-driven-design/</a></li><li><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/using-statistics-in-ux-design-f0113b084dc4" rel="noopener">https://uxdesign.cc/using-statistics-in-ux-design-f0113b084dc4</a></li><li><a href="https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d" rel="noopener">https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d</a></li><li><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/data-driven-design/?source=post_page---------------------------" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.invisionapp.com/design-defined/data-driven-design/?source=post_page---------------------------</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unintended Consequences in Design.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>How many times in your life have you wondered seeing the alternative possibilities of a particular product?

We, humans, are creative, we tend to find opportunities from every single thing that come across in our lives. Be it using Instagram for showcasing your merchandise, or checking internet availability by typing “google.com” in your browser.</p><p>Identifying alternative opportunities or utilizing the product beyond its intended use is cool. However, we, humans tend to use products in our own way regardless of the intended purpose of the product leads to unintended consequences.</p><h1 id="what-are-unintended-consequences">What are unintended consequences?</h1><p>I ran a search in google seeking the definition of unintended consequences returned with this:</p><blockquote>“In the social sciences, unintended consequences are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action.” — Robert Merton.</blockquote><p>When I read that, it didn’t sound so alarming to me, but then when I logged into LinkedIn I saw a post from one of my follower and it says: “You have Facebook, Instagram and specifically tinder for dating, please don’t use LinkedIn for seeking your potential dating targets”. Now, this left me disturbed, I was puzzled, and I felt bad.</p><p>Coincidentally, I was sent to Design up Conference 2017, which was held in Bangalore by my company then, Kerala Startup Mission where I heard Alysha Naples talking about unintended consequences and that helped me to broaden my understanding.</p><p>During her session, she mentioned one of her experience from the game “Journey” in which, another player in the game was drawing a heart to her without knowing who she is. When the journey team designed the game, they never thought about the ability of the game to give an emotional connection to the player in an aforementioned manner.</p><blockquote><em><em>“I cried, I cried for about an hour. I felt like this person whose name I didn’t know. It can be anyone, we stuck together, fought together, we struggle together and I felt an intensely deep sense of gratitude for being there and leaving this beautiful message to me at the end” — Alysha Naples</em></em></blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-GI_tI5uiUa6frF4Zbnanvw.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Unintended Consequences in Design."><figcaption>An image captured from the game Journey</figcaption></figure><p>While the experience from the journey was benevolent and touchy, there can be some instances in which users might go to the dark side to satisfy their evil intentions. One among those was reported by a female player who was playing QuiVr in 2017. She was playing the game with 5 unknown teammates and at some point, she has to yell through the voice channel. As soon as her teammates heard her voice, they realized that their teammate is a woman. They started chasing her and groping her avatar. Even though the woman was safe in the coziness of her room, this incident made her feel that she was being violated.</p><p>Along with this, I need to mention that, QuiVr replied to the article with an update which helps players to create a force field around them which will avoid other players from the vicinity.</p><h2 id="is-unintended-consequences-only-affecting-games">Is unintended consequences only affecting games?</h2><p>You’ve guessed it right. Unintended consequences were in existence since the day mankind started innovation. Did you think that Karl Benz wanted the world to be filled with cars which spit tons of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases and in turn cause damage to earth?</p><p>I’m not sure how many of you are aware of SQL injection. Its one of the most common hacking method in which the hacker injects code which could destroy the entire database via an input field, which is used to accept inputs from the users. Most of the web companies are taking precautions to prevent these type of attacks in the current era.</p><p>Talking about unintended consequences, one of my friend who was learning from a popular MOOC platform received a message from another user in who reviewed her project as a part of their peer-to-peer assessment praising her physical beauty and seeking her private number. The result, she felt violated and threatened thinking that if she doesn’t give her cellphone number, the other guy won’t be giving enough score to her assignment.</p><p>If you notice the pattern I shared above, you will realize that it’s been there, and it’s all prevailing. From knives to the most sophisticated tech. If not designed properly, all of them have the ability to cause something which was never intended during its production stage.</p><h1 id="can-we-prevent-unintended-consequences">Can we prevent unintended consequences?</h1><p>Well, Most of them. I know, I wanted to say all of them. The fact that we can’t manipulate or control the human mind with an <em><em>Imperial curse</em></em> is the only reason I’m saying that we can’t get rid of unintended consequences altogether.</p><p>I believe that Designers can prevent unintended consequences by considering the following steps:<br>1. Asking the right questions<br>2. What is really being said<br>3. Wearing the black hat<br>4. Observing the usage of the product.</p><h2 id="1-asking-the-right-questions">1.Asking the right questions</h2><p>When we are designing something, we need to ask ourselves questions like, why are we designing these? What are the elements are we going to have in these? why do we need these elements? who are the users of this product?</p><p>Referring to the experience my friend had from MOOC learning platform, this situation won’t ever happen if the peer who reviewed her assignment couldn’t see her profile picture or name. Being an active user of the same platform, I believe that the peer’s name and profile picture doesn’t add any value to the process as you are merely reviewing the assignments. Hence, if the designers from that particular company have asked the questions related to the visibility of the profile picture and name to themselves, this situation could’ve been avoided.</p><h2 id="2-what-is-really-being-said">2.What is really being said?</h2><p>This is something designers often get into. There can be instances when someone from the product team approaches the designers and says “Hey, do you know, our users just responded in the survey that they want text messaging in our latest VR product”. This is the moment we need to differentiate the form and the essence.</p><p>The form might differ, but the essence always remains the same. If users replied affirmatively to a question towards having a text message feature in the latest VR app. It might mean that they want something in the app using which they can easily communicate with the people whom they care about.</p><h2 id="3-wearing-the-blackhat-">3.Wearing the blackhat.</h2><p>I love to believe that all of us wants to be the good guys. Most of us believe that we want to change the world for the better good. However, while designing a product which we want to make a social impact, we need to wear the blackhat. We need to consider ourselves as a villain who tries to manipulate the social aspects of our product to achieve evil motives.</p><blockquote><em><em>Is a knife evil? Only if the wielder is evil.</em></em></blockquote><h2 id="4-observing-the-usage-of-the-product-">4.Observing the usage of the product.</h2><p>Amongst all, this is my favorite part. When the female gamer reported about the terrible experience she had in QuiVr with her teammates. QuiVr team reciprocated with a solution to avoid further repetition of that incident.</p><p>No matter how hard we try, there can be instances in which we couldn’t think of a particular scenario which might affect in bad experience to a player.</p><blockquote>Own mistakes, Improvise on it. Unintended consequences can be avoided if we are vigilant about it pre and post stages of production.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design for business]]></title><description><![CDATA[Design for business talks about how you can use design to improvise your business by applying different methodologies.]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/design-for-business/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5edc8b1bcb4d9c054f2124e3</guid><category><![CDATA[Blog]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ruwaiz Razak]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-vlsoaZWot_ig5SX2Px8Cvg.jpeg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-vlsoaZWot_ig5SX2Px8Cvg.jpeg" alt="Design for business"><p>Design, does this word brings any images to you? we live in the world where we have lots of professionals under this tag, and myself fortunate enough to be one of them.</p><p>John Maeda, the legendary designer who addresses himself as a product manager who learns data science says that “Design is always about selling things”</p><blockquote>“Design is always about selling things” — John Maeda.</blockquote><p>However, whenever I address myself as a user experience designer, most of the people relate my field of work with graphics designing or user interface designing.</p><h1 id="what-is-design">What is design?</h1><p>I just ran a search on the same query and the google surfaced me this :- “Design is a work process which has a user perspective and drives development based on your specific customers’ needs.” — svid.se</p><p>To make things short, the design is all about making things easy for customers and for stakeholders.</p><p>Let’s take an example on a retail store and see how design can help in a retail store, so that we can see how design not just about apps and websites.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-qhW-8DI52Om0ksRZI6BgNA.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Design for business"></figure><p>Have you ever noticed in a retail store that you can take a packet of cookies for 2$ and beside that there is a bundle of 3 packets of cookies with 5$? and how many times you picked the 5$ bundle even though you just needed a single pack?</p><p>This is mentioned as “Decoy effect” by <em><em>Dan Ariely. </em></em>The <strong><strong>decoy effect</strong></strong> is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated.</p><p>In his book, Predicbly irrational, Dan also talks about how the economist.com used the same effect to get more subscribers towards an expensive pack.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-RI-0FqT9OTki4MO4bTLL9A.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Design for business"></figure><p>Did you notice that in the left side with the presence <strong><strong>print subscription</strong></strong>(decoy,) the number of subscribers for <strong><strong>Print &amp; web subscription </strong></strong>is 84%.

I’m from India and we are so fortunate to have a democratic government which is defined by Abraham Lincoln as “<em><em>Of the people, By the People, For the people</em></em>”.</p><p>All the government bodies are purposed to solve a particular problem for the public. However, even though there are lots of Boards, Missions, Agencies to address various problems in the region, these are not really effective in solving the problem.</p><blockquote>Govt bodies are not really effective in solving the problem.</blockquote><p>People do asks me, even though there are lots of bodies like this why the problems aren’t solved? Well, we can answer this in many ways, we can blame these on the government, we can blame these on the Organisations, We can blame these on the people, and we can blame these on us too, and why? Because we are part of this society.</p><p>However, these issues can be well addressed and solved only when we understand the current position and the position we have to achieve. This is the part where an Experience Officer comes to play.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-experience-officer-a-wizard">What is an Experience Officer?

But hold on, Most of the government agencies works towards a well defined mission which means they know their goals, but mostly they get lost in the execution.</p><p>This is the place where an experience officer have the role to play. The experience officer is meant to identify the problem and the tag the associated problems as well. There is an old saying that “A Problem left understood cant be solved.”</p><p>Hence the experience officer is meant to get details about the problems from the set of public who are identified as the target audience. Once he acquires the details regarding problem, then creating a user journey map would help in understanding most of the issues that would come up during the execution of the mission.</p><p>Also, the experience officer can have a look at the models that has been created to solve the identical problems in other places.</p><blockquote><em><em>To summarise, a CXO can use</em></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><em>1.

While this is a cafe, I’ve been spending my weekdays in a co-working space for last 6 months, and what do I gain from it? is it tedious to work if you are surrounded by lots of people who aren’t even in your company? or Is it hard to tolerate every single comment passed by people even though they aren’t in your company?</p><p>Lots of people ask me similar questions. But what we need to keep in mind that, when you are surrounded by lots of people from the different background you are the one who is actually benefitted. We, the user experience designers are advocates for the users. hence we often need to step out of our rooms and get to meet different people and to collect their likes and dislikes.</p><p>We can do this by different methodologies, but if you are in a co-working space, all you need is ask to your fellow coworkers, regardless of the company they are from (Be respectful to their schedule though.).</p><p>If you are in a co-working space, chances that you are surrounded by following set of people.</p><ul><li>CEOs</li><li>Network Engineers</li><li>Developers</li><li>Designers (User Interface)</li><li>Designers (UX)</li><li>Students (Who comes for internships)</li><li>and Nontechnical people.</li></ul><p>Recently I came across a project that had 7 personas from a different background, and I needed to conduct an open card sorting technique in crafting the informational architecture. As the project i was working on would interact with user at least twice a day, i had to assure that it delivers the best experience for the user.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/1-5KVXzDThyx8PJjEg3jdVJQ.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="How is co-working space helping me as a UXer?"></figure><p>Hence i thought of conducting 15 Card sorting for each persona. Which means i would conduct 10 card sorting under one persona and like that I will do for the rest 6. which means I have to talk to at least 10 x 7 = 70 people to conduct my exercise and to record them as well.</p><p>Reaching out to 70 people just for a single task is hard when you handle every aspect of the design and all you have is a time of two weeks. But the above task was quite easy as I got 40 people within my coworking space and all I had to ask them was to come to me when they are free for few minutes, and it worked quite well.</p><p>Not to mention the advantages when you have developers and other designers in your proximity so that they can enlighten you with certain technologies, different methods or even you can indulge in a debate over the methodologies or the tools you use.</p><p>If you are fortunate enough, you might be reached by some of the companies in your co-working space to get an advice on their product or maybe with a problem. When you have free time and if you are looking for consistent improvement in your knowledge and experience this is quite a blessing, as you will get to know a problem which you never heard of and an opportunity to find a solution for the same which would make you better.</p><blockquote>To all my fellow “UXers”, embrace the people around you as they are your key to perfection, get to know them, study them, use them without harming them, and most importantly, respect them.</blockquote><p>signing off,<br>Ruwaiz Razak</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design responsibly.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<blockquote><em>“A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all women, men, and children.

We have to anticipate the unintended consequences. — Alysha Naples.”</em></em></em></blockquote><p>As a designer, That invited my attention to the one below.</p><h2 id="technology-a-boon-or-bane">Technology, a boon? or bane?</h2><p>We, as a technocrat, shower a lot of praises over technology and its ability to overcome men in certain areas. However, There could be some unintentional consequences that would lead to catastrophic events.</p><h2 id="tay-super-cool-to-super-abusive-in-a-day-">Tay: Super Cool to Super Abusive in a day.</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/tay.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Design responsibly."></figure><p>Microsoft are the parents of <em><em>Tay</em></em>, a super cool chat bot which (or should i say who) is built as an experiment towards <em><em>conversational understanding</em></em>.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>“The more you chat with Tay, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through casual and playful conversation” — Microsoft.</em></em></em></blockquote><p>The conversations Tay had with people was astonishing and it did got smarter as the company claimed. But, the unintended consequences where yet to come. In less than 24 hours, <em><em>Tay</em></em> became a racist, abusive chatbot and Microsoft had to pull it off the internet.</p><p>Tay’s conversations are a joke, but it does raises lots of questions, like how are we going to teach Artificial Intelligence to use data without incorporating the worst traits of humans? how do we program AI in such a way that it would ignore the human trashes even though it is designed to feed on the data human’s provide?</p><blockquote>This would question our entire assumptions towards designing the technology. Should we design to create a better experiences for the user or should we thrive to mesmerise users by the technical terms that we use in the product?</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
